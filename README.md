# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview: 
The goal of this project is to process data for an unsupervised machine learning model for clients preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. Originally, there was no known output for what is expected with the data, the reason unsupervised machine learning is used. This report includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
Clustering and the K-means algorithm will be used to conduct the analysis. The model is made more efficient in this project using Principle Component Analysis. 
#### Steps: 
* Pre-process and clean data
* Reduce data dimensions using Principle Component Analysis
* Clustering using K-means algorithm
* Visualizing results using 2D and 3D scatter plots
